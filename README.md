## Introduction 🌟

We are building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.

## Setting Up 💻

First, we need to create a new React app. Open your terminal and run:

``
npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe
``

This command sets up a new React project with a good default configuration. Navigate into your project's folder:

``
cd tic-tac-toe
``

## Folder Structure 📂

Your initial project structure will look something like this:

tic-tac-toe/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
└── package.json

- `node_modules/`: Libraries and utilities.
- `public/`: Static files like HTML and images.
- `src/`: Your React code lives here.

## Creating Components 🛠

### Board Component

Create a new folder called `components` inside the `src` folder. Inside `components`, create a file named `Board.js`.

#### Board.js

``
// Importing required modules
import React from 'react';
import Square from './Square';  // We'll create this component next

// Board component
const Board = ({ squares, onClick }) => {
  // Function to render a single square
  const renderSquare = (i) => (
    <Square value={squares[i]} onClick={() => onClick(i)} />
  );

  return (
    <div className="board">
      {renderSquare(0)}
      {renderSquare(1)}
      {renderSquare(2)}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Board;
``

### Square Component

Create another file inside the `components` folder and name it `Square.js`.

#### Square.js

``
// Importing required modules
import React from 'react';

// Square component
const Square = ({ value, onClick }) => (
  <button className="square" onClick={onClick}>
    {value}
  </button>
);

export default Square;
``

### App Component

Your `App.js` will serve as the container for these components.

#### App.js

``
// Importing required modules and components
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Board from './components/Board';
import { calculateWinner } from './utils';  // We'll create this utility next

// Main App component
const App = () => {
  // ... (State and functions here)
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* ... (Your components here) */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
``

## React Theory 🎓

### State

In React, state is a way to manage data that changes over time. For example, the Tic-Tac-Toe board's squares are managed using state.

### Props

Props are a way for React components to use data passed in from their parent component.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

## Potential Warnings and Errors ⚠️

- **Infinite Loop**: Be careful when setting state within the component body to avoid infinite re-renders.
- **Key Prop**: When rendering lists in React, make sure to provide a unique "key" prop.

## Glossary 📚

- **Component**: A self-contained module that renders some output.
- **JSX**: Syntax extension for JavaScript, used with React to describe what the UI should look like.
- **Hook**: Special function that lets you use state and other React features.
- **State**: Data that changes over time.
- **Props**: Short for "properties," data passed down from a parent component.

**Happy Coding!** 🎉
